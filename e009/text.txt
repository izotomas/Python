GARAGE TERRACE HOUSE
Designed around a couple's love for automobiles, the Garage Terrace House is a car enthusiasts dream. A wall of floor to ceiling windows keep the owner's pride and joy on display from the adjacent kitchen and living area, while the continuation of concrete flooring makes the garage feel one with the interior. Raised timber ceilings and the use of natural light expand the modest 1800-square-foot space. When extra room is needed, your ride could be, dare we say it, parked outside and the garage can be converted into a covered terrace.
